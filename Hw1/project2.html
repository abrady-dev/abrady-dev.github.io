        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            For this project I took an old Mac Mini that my family had laying around and decided to turn it into a 
            networkwide adblocker using Pi-Hole. Pi-Hole is a free and open source software that is used to help filter DNS requests
            when you are browsing the internet. By filtering DNS requests Pi-Hole is able to block ads, trackers, and other unwanted content.
            For my use case I took the Mac Mini and installed Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS on it. From there I installed Pi-Hole and configured it to work with my home network.
