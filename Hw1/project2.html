        <h1>Pi-Hole Adblocker</h1>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            For this project I took an old Mac Mini that my family had laying around and decided to turn it into a 
            networkwide adblocker using Pi-Hole. Pi-Hole is a free and open source software that is used to help filter DNS requests
            when you are browsing the internet. By filtering DNS requests Pi-Hole is able to block ads, trackers, and other unwanted content.
            For my use case I took the Mac Mini and installed Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS on it. From there I installed Pi-Hole and configured it to work with my home network.

        <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
        <p>
            While working on this project I learned a lot about Linux and networking. I learned how to install and configure Ubuntu Server
            and how to set up Pi-Hole to work with my home network. I also learned about DNS and how it works, as well as how to configure
            my home router to use Pi-Hole as its primary DNS server. Additionally I learned about the importance of network security and how
            using a networkwide adblocker can help protect my devices from unwated traffic. Additionally I made it so that this would be the secondary DNS filter on my  network in case it fails.
            In the event that it does my network is set up so that all traffic will be routed through my home server that is also running Pi-Hole through docker.
