        <h1>TrueNas HomeLab</h1>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            For my home lab I built a server that runs TrueNas CE. TrueNas is a free and open source linux based operating system.
            It's primary purpose is to be used a private cloud storage solution. However TrueNas also has the ability to host various services 
            using docker containers or virtual machines. Currently my TrueNas server host a few services such as Pi-Hole, Uptime Kuma, 
            Tailscale and VaultWarden and a few others. You can find out more about my HomeLab at this link here.

        <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
        <p>
            While building my home lab I learned a lot about computer hardware and networking. I learned how to pick compatible parts for a custom build
            and how to assemble them into a working system. I also learned how to configure TrueNas and set up various services using docker containers.
            Additionally I learned about networking concepts such as DNS, DHCP, and VPNs while setting up Pi-Hole and Tailscale on my server and the importance
            of having a fully private password manager. Also having about 12 terabytes of personal storage is pretty usseful.
