        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            For my home lab I built a server that runs TrueNas CE. TrueNas is a free and open source linux based operating system.
            It's primary purpose is to be used a private cloud storage solution. However TrueNas also has the ability to host various services 
            using docker containers or virtual machines. Currently my TrueNas server host a few services such as Pi-Hole, Uptime Kuma, 
            Tailscale and VaultWarden and a few others. You can find out more about my HomeLab at this link here.
